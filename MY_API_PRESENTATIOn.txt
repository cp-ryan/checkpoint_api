# Check Point Automation & APIs

### Spinning up vms faster than blink

### Automate snapshot and backups

### Automate management

- Create policies on the fly
- Install them

### Hardcore Test

- Export everything
- Destroy the instance
- Respin & redeploy "super fast"



# Introduction

- Rise of devops
- The need for automation is strong
- No one wants to set up 1,000 security polices with a mouse
- Automation allows large deployments to happen super fast

Introduciton:
  - Start with hate of the mouse
  - We all want to speed up deployment process, we can all relate
    Hate waiting on something to deploy
    Whenever you do something over and over robotically, it can be automated
    So lets not waste our time doing things that can just be automated, lets use the API

  GOALS
  - Help you understand the language of dev ops and their need
  - Understand basic core concepts behind the api
  - Also help you be more efficient in your lab deployments


What I want to learn:

  - Create policeis on the fly
  - Download all settings/polcies and spin them over real easy
  - Use the config_system in the api
  - Make machines fast! (both deployment & creating settings)
  - Automate the creation of a Security Checkup box!
  - What the hell is yml files
  - How to use ansible
  - Deploy on cloud
